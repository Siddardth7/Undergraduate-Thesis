# Undergraduate Thesis: Structural, Microstructural, and Mechanical Characterization of Borosilicate-Based Glass‑Ceramic Composites

## Overview
This repository contains the original reports and presentation slides from my final‑year undergraduate thesis project on borosilicate‑based glass‑ceramic composites. The goal of the project was to design and fabricate glass‑ceramic composites, study their microstructure, and evaluate mechanical properties under various processing conditions.

## Problem Statement
Glass‑ceramics offer the lightweight, high‑temperature stability and corrosion resistance required for aerospace and structural applications. By tailoring composition and heat‑treatment schedules, it is possible to transform a parent glass into a two‑phase microstructure comprising a crystalline phase within a residual glass matrix. The resulting microstructure strongly influences mechanical properties like flexural strength, fracture toughness and hardness. In this thesis, we investigate borosilicate‑based glass‑ceramic composites reinforced with alumina, spinel or zirconia, focusing on how composition and processing conditions affect the final microstructure and mechanical performance.

## Methodology
1. **Batch Preparation and Melting:** Starting compositions were calculated based on targeted crystalline phases (e.g., anorthite, cordierite, zirconia). Raw materials (silica, boric acid, alumina, magnesia etc.) were weighed, mixed and melted in a platinum crucible at temperatures of 1350‑1500 °C. The melts were cast into steel moulds and annealed to relieve thermal stresses.
2. **Heat Treatment:** The parent glasses were heat treated using differential thermal analysis (DTA) data to determine nucleation and crystallization temperatures. Typical schedules involved nucleation at 600‑700 °C and crystallization at 900‑1100 °C with hold times of 1‑4 h.
3. **Sample Preparation:** Heat‑treated billets were cut and polished into rectangular bars (typically 60 × 10 × 4 mm) for mechanical testing and small sections for microstructural examination.
4. **Microstructural Characterization:** The crystallized samples were examined using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X‑ray diffraction (XRD) was used to identify crystalline phases and estimate crystallinity. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used for qualitative compositional analysis.
5. **Mechanical Testing:** Three‑point flexural strength was measured using a universal testing machine (UTM) with span lengths of 40 mm. Vickers hardness testing was performed on polished surfaces under a 1 kg load. Fracture surfaces were analyzed to identify failure origins and crack‑deflection mechanisms.
6. **Data Analysis:** Flexural strength data were analyzed statistically to determine mean and standard deviation. Micrographs were correlated with mechanical results to understand the influence of microstructure on failure mechanisms.

## Key Results
- **Phase Formation:** XRD patterns confirmed the formation of anorthite and cordierite as major crystalline phases with minor zirconia/spinel depending on composition. Crystallinity increased with longer hold times, resulting in a finer interlocking microstructure.
- **Microstructure:** SEM images showed fine dendritic crystals embedded in a glassy matrix. Increased alumina content promoted the formation of elongated anorthite crystals, leading to improved crack deflection and higher fracture toughness. Porosity and residual glass pockets were minimized by optimizing heat‑treatment schedules.
- **Mechanical Properties:** Flexural strength values ranged from 80 MPa for partially crystallized samples to over 160 MPa for well‑crystallized compositions. Vickers hardness increased from 5 GPa in the parent glass to over 7 GPa after crystallization. Samples with interlocking microstructures exhibited the highest strengths due to crack‑branching and energy dissipation.
- **Fractography:** Fracture surfaces revealed transgranular and intergranular fracture modes. Crack deflection at crystal‑glass interfaces and branching through secondary phases contributed to increased energy absorption. Failure often initiated at surface defects or residual porosity.

## Conclusion
The study demonstrates that borosilicate‑based glass‑ceramic composites can be engineered with tailored microstructures and mechanical properties by controlling composition and heat‑treatment parameters. A higher concentration of network modifiers (e.g., MgO, CaO, Al₂O₃) promotes nucleation and growth of crystalline phases, leading to improved flexural strength and hardness. Microstructural control is critical for minimizing porosity and maximizing crack‑deflection mechanisms. These findings provide a framework for designing glass‑ceramic composites for high‑temperature structural applications.
